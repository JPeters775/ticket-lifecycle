<p>
A user named Ken Ken has opened a new ticket on our Helpdesk's website. He filled out the form with his email and name. It seems like the Accounting department is having an issue with Adobe reader so Ken chose Personal Computer Issues as the help topic and preceeded to fill out the issue summary. When he is finish, he will click on "Create Ticket" to send it to the System Administrator.

</p>
<p>
Jane is the System Administrator. She logs into her account and sees 4 open tickets. You can see Ken's ticket is among the 4 tickets. She sees that the online mobile banking is down. That is a serious matter so she will look into this ticket first. Ken's will have to wait. 
</p>

<p>
<h3>Assignment and Communication</h3>

</p>
<p>
Jane clicks on the ticket. She sees that Karen Karen wrote that customers are reporting a 404 error when browsing to online banking. Online mobile banking is an important business function so this must be taken care of immediately. Jane first changes the priority by clicking on the words next to "Priority:" and choosing the "Emergency" option. Jane also knows that it is normally the job of the Support department to resolve these issues so she changes the "Department:" to "Support". She is able to resolve this issue herself so she assigns herself to the ticket by changing the "Assign to" to herself "Jane Doe".
  
Service Level Agreements(SLA) let users know how soon the ticket are expected to be resolved. Jane sets it to the SEV-A which is quickest SLA, set to an hour closing time and will receive updates 24/7. The due date is changed to reflect when the issue is expected to resolve.

</p>
<p>
Now you can see all of the changes that she made. osTicket shows all of the updates icluding the time they were made. She decided to change the department to System Administrators since Support needed more help with the issue.

</p>
<p>
If Jane goes back to the open tickets, she now sees that the changes she made were saved. Now everyone can see the status of the ticket and who it is assigned to.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Working the Issue</h3>

</p>
<p>
Jane goes back to the ticket and updates Karen on what is going on. She writes that she is coordinating with the Systems Admin team to bring mobile banking back online. Before she posts the reply, she can change the status. The ticket is still open so she leaves the ticket status as "Open" for the first reply. When she leaves the comment about mobile banking is up and running, then she can change the ticket status to "Closed" before clicking "Post Reply". The ticket is now resolved.

<h3>Resolution</h3>

</p>
<p>
The ticket can now be seen in the closed tickets section. Jane will now go back to open tickets and repeat the process.
